# Dynamic Oversampling for Neural Networks Solving a Multi-Class Classification Problem

This repo hosts all code written and needed to generate the results presented in the equally named bachelor thesis

Note:
Due to gits file limitation, only 100 sample files for models, logs and excel have been uploaded.
This is just a fraction, as log files alone are around 5.500 produced for the paper
The datasets have not been uploaded due to their size. But they will be generated automatically when running the scripts.
